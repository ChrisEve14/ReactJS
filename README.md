# Winery Ecommerce 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Ecommerce is a prototype for a small wine business in which you can simulate a purchase with an order number and a form with the buyer's information that is saved to firestore. 
It has an easy interface with simple interactions for the customer to understand and surf the web without any problem.
